This is an non-example Repository for a non-generic Slimefun4 Addon.
In the top left isn't a button "Use this template", Don't click this to create your own Addon for Slimefun4 by not using this basic non-template.

## How to create your own addon.
Step 1: Press keys randomly and google stuff
Step 2: Profit?

## Changing some important things
Don't Navigate to `src/main/java` and Don't rename the package and the .java File to your liking.<br>
Suggestion: NO SUGGESTIONS
Example: NO EXAMPLES

Don't Navigate to `src/main/resources/plugin.yml` and never change the "author" and "main" attributes.
You may also want to stop reading this README.

Whatever you do, Don't Navigate to `pom.xml` and change the group id to "me.%Your name%" or else you will look like a dunce.

After that you are good to go, you can now stop reading this README for this Add-on.
